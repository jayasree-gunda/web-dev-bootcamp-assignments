00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Mary had a little lamb

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Everywhere that Mary went

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Everywhere that Mary went

00:00:25.500 --> 00:27:02.000
The lamb was sure to go

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
It followed her to school one day

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.300
School one day, school one day

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
It followed her to school one day

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Which was againts the rules

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
It made the children laugh and play

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Laugh and play, laugh and play

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
It made the children laugh and play

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
To see the lamb at school

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
